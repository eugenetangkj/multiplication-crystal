# Multiplication Mania

Multiplication Mania is a simple web application built using React, created in the form of a game. Players will have to answer multiplication questions involving time tables from 1 to 12 and reach a total score of 10 to obtain the Multiplication Crystal, a proof that one is good in multiplication. One mark is added for each correct answer, while one mark is deducted for each wrong answer.

Think you are good in multiplication? Try out [Multiplication Mania](https://nimble-treacle-5e16eb.netlify.app/) now!
